# image_to_ttf

Turn hand-drawn or pixel-art glyph grids into a working TTF font — quick, simple, and open-source-ready.

Built on a polite dare from a great designer [exexexperiment](https://instagram.com/exexexperiment). 
Have a wild idea for a creative tool? Slide into his DM — he'll guilt-trip me into making it.

Overview
- Draw each glyph in a square grid (one glyph per cell).
- Export the grid image (edge-to-edge) and upload it to the converter.
- Run the converter (Google Colab or local script) to generate a `.ttf` font.

Status
- Code is not committed yet — this repo holds the project scaffolding and docs.
- Want to help? Contributions, demo notebooks, and sample images are very welcome.

Quick usage (concept)

1. Prepare a single image with your glyphs laid out in a regular grid.
2. Make sure cells are consistent in size and spacing.
3. Run the converter to output a TTF file you can install and share.

How you can help
- Share sample images and a short demo GIF (grid → install → type).
- Add a Colab notebook for one-click demos.
- Open issues for bugs or feature ideas.

Next steps we recommend
- Add an `LICENSE` (MIT recommended) and `LICENSE` file.
- Add a runnable Colab link and example images in `/examples`.
- Add simple CLI usage and a minimal test to validate outputs.
